**Temporary ReadMe: 

This repository contains multiple jupyter notebooks comparing the hls4ml versions of a handful of Neural Networks to their regular counterparts.

The paths provided in the notebooks are specific to my computer. The general paths for downloading the models and data used can be found in the spreadsheet.

These paths will later be added to this ReadMe, as well as further detail on the models themselves.
