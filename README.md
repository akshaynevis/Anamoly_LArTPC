# Anamoly Detection for LArTPC: 

This repository contains multiple jupyter notebooks comparing the hls4ml versions of a handful of Neural Networks to their regular counterparts.

## Usage:

Each notebook is the name of a specific neural network model. Each notebook currently tests the consistency between the python implementation of the neural network model and the hls4ml version of the same model. Note the paths provided for the models in the notebooks are specific to my computer. The general paths for downloading the models and data used can be found in the spreadsheet.

## Plans:

We are currently in the process of testing building these hls4ml models. When this process is complete, those updates will be pushed.
